# Facial-Expression-Recognition-in-Keras
A convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras to recognize facial expressions The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The network classifies each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). Uses OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. The trained model is directly served to a web interface and performs real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.  Dataset The data can be found here
